# libraryproject
📚✨ I just built a Mini Library Data Handling Project using Node.js & Express.js!

This project is a simple REST API that simulates how a library might manage its book records.

🔧 Features:

GET /books → View all books in the library

GET /books/:id → View details of a single book

POST /books → Add a new book to the library

DELETE /books/:id → Remove a book from the library

⚙️ Tech Stack:

Node.js

Express.js

Body-Parser

💡 Key Learnings:

Handling CRUD operations in REST APIs

Using dynamic routes (:id) in Express

Difference between find(), filter(), and splice() for data handling

Structuring data as a JSON array (like a library database)

This was a fun exercise that gave me practical exposure to backend development and API building. 🚀
Excited to expand this further into a more complete library management system with update functionality and maybe even database integration later.
